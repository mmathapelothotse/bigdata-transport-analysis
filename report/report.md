## **Executive Summary**

This report presents a comprehensive Big Data analysis of the New York City Yellow Taxi trip dataset using MapReduce and visualization techniques. Building on Part 1, this phase extracts actionable insights through distributed processing.

Three MapReduce jobs were implemented:
1. Peak hour traffic patterns
2. Tipping behavior across payment types and trip distances
3. Route profitability analysis

The dataset contains over **10 GB** and **600 million** trip records. Key findings include:
- Peak demand between 5–7 PM
- Correlation between trip distance and tipping
- Most profitable pickup-dropoff routes

These insights support fleet optimization, driver allocation, and revenue strategies.

## **Introduction**

### **Background and Context**

NYC’s taxi system generates millions of trip records daily. Analyzing this data requires Big Data technologies like MapReduce, which splits tasks into:
- **Map phase**: filtering and transformation
- **Reduce phase**: aggregation and summarization

### **Project Objectives**

- Implement MapReduce algorithms
- Process large-scale taxi data
- Create meaningful visualizations
- Apply Big Data concepts
- Extract business value

### **Dataset Overview**

**Schema:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| VendorID | Integer | TPEP provider ID |
| tpep_pickup_datetime | Timestamp | Trip start time |
| tpep_dropoff_datetime | Timestamp | Trip end time |
| passenger_count | Double | Number of passengers |
| trip_distance | Double | Distance in miles |
| PULocationID | Integer | Pickup zone ID |
| DOLocationID | Integer | Dropoff zone ID |
| payment_type | Integer | Payment method |
| fare_amount | Double | Base fare |
| tip_amount | Double | Tip |
| total_amount | Double | Total cost |

**Statistics:**
- Size: **10.5 GB**
- Records: ** 638+ million**
- Time Period: **January 2019 - December 2024 (6 years)**
- Format: Parquet (converted to CSV)

---

## **Methodology**

### **Technical Architecture**

**Stack:**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Custom MapReduce (Python)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- VSCode, Git Bash

### **Data Preprocessing**

Steps:
1. Load Parquet files
2. Select relevant columns
3. Remove missing values
4. Export to CSV
5. Validate format

### **MapReduce Implementation**

#### **Job 1: Peak Hour Traffic Analysis**

**Mapper:**
```python
def peak_hour_mapper(line):
    fields = line.strip().split(',')
    pickup_time = fields[0]
    location_id = fields[1]
    dt = datetime.fromisoformat(pickup_time)
    hour = dt.hour
    return (hour, location_id, 1)
```

**Reducer:**
```python
def peak_hour_reducer(mapped_data):
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for hour, location, count in mapped_data:
        key = f"{hour}	{location}"
        counts[key] += count
    return counts
```

**Business Value:** Driver allocation and surge pricing.

---

#### **Job 2: Tipping Behavior Analysis**

**Mapper:**
```python
def tipping_mapper(line):
    fields = line.strip().split(',')
    trip_distance = float(fields[4])
    fare_amount = float(fields[5])
    tip_amount = float(fields[6])
    payment_type = fields[8]
    tip_percentage = (tip_amount / fare_amount) * 100
    category = "short" if trip_distance < 2 else "medium" if trip_distance < 10 else "long"
    return (payment_type, category, tip_percentage)
```

**Reducer:** Calculates average tip percentages.

**Business Value:** Payment method promotions and driver incentives.

---

#### **Job 3: Route Profitability Analysis**

**Mapper:**
```python
def route_profit_mapper(line):
    fields = line.strip().split(',')
    pickup_loc = fields[1]
    dropoff_loc = fields[2]
    trip_distance = float(fields[4])
    total_amount = float(fields[7])
    revenue_per_mile = total_amount / trip_distance
    route = f"{pickup_loc}-{dropoff_loc}"
    return (route, total_amount, trip_distance, revenue_per_mile)
```

**Reducer:** Aggregates revenue and ranks top 100 routes.

**Business Value:** Route optimization and strategic positioning.

## **Results and Analysis**

### **Peak Hour Traffic Patterns**

**Findings:**
- Morning Peak: 7–9 AM
- Evening Peak: 5–7 PM (highest)
- Off-Peak: 2–5 AM
- Weekend: Extended evening peaks

**Implications:**
- Dynamic pricing during 5–7 PM
- 30–40% more drivers during peaks
- Reduce fleet during off-peak
- Incentives for off-peak riders

---

### **Tipping Behavior Insights**

**Findings:**
- Credit card: Avg [A]% tip
- Cash: Avg [B]% tip
- Short trips: [C]%
- Medium trips: [D]%
- Long trips: [E]%

**Implications:**
- Promote cashless payments
- Optimize tip suggestions
- Educate drivers on service quality
- Loyalty programs for medium trips

### **Route Profitability Analysis**

**Top 5 Routes:**

| Route | Total Revenue | Trips | Avg $/Mile |
|-------|---------------|-------|------------|
| [Route 1] | $[Amount] | [Count] | $[Rate] |
| [Route 2] | $[Amount] | [Count] | $[Rate] |
| [Route 3] | $[Amount] | [Count] | $[Rate] |
| [Route 4] | $[Amount] | [Count] | $[Rate] |
| [Route 5] | $[Amount] | [Count] | $[Rate] |

**Implications:**
- Position drivers near profitable zones
- Airport shuttle services
- Route-specific driver programs
- Corporate partnerships
